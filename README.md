The Diabetes Prediction System is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning techniques, specifically a deep learning model. This project, developed as part of an AI assignment, leverages the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train a neural network and provides a user-friendly interface for inputting health metrics and receiving predictions. Version 4 introduces improved model accuracy and Docker-based deployment, building on previous versions with enhanced backend stability and performance.

Key Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a neural network with BatchNormalization, LeakyReLU, and EarlyStopping for better accuracy.
Web Interface: A responsive frontend built with Node.js, allowing users to input health data and view predictions.
Docker Deployment: Backend Flask API packaged in a Docker container for easy deployment and scalability.
Accuracy Improvement: Optimized model architecture to achieve higher prediction accuracy compared to earlier versions.
