The Diabetes Prediction System is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning techniques, specifically a deep learning model. This project, developed as part of an AI assignment, leverages the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train a neural network and provides a user-friendly interface for inputting health metrics and receiving predictions. Version 4 introduces improved model accuracy and Docker-based deployment, building on previous versions with enhanced backend stability and performance.
